# 📰 Fake News Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to classify news articles as real or fake using machine learning techniques. It processes text data, applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and trains a model to detect fake news.

## 🚀 Features
- 📝 **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization.
- 🔍 **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF Vectorization.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, etc.
- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

## 🏗 How It Works
1. **Data Loading**: Reads dataset containing labeled real and fake news articles.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes text, removes stopwords.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF.
4. **Model Training**: Trains machine learning models for classification.
5. **Evaluation**: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance.
