# Fake-News-Detector
# Project Description
A machine learning model that classifies news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and various classification algorithms.

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a fake news classifier using Python and machine learning. The notebook shows the complete workflow from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

# Dataset
The project uses the WELFake_Dataset.csv which contains:

Text content of news articles

Labels (1 for fake, 0 for real)
